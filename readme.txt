# ESP8266 Buzzer Control and ThingSpeak Integration

This Arduino sketch demonstrates how to control a buzzer using an ESP8266 WiFi module and send status data to ThingSpeak cloud platform.

## Prerequisites

- ESP8266 board installed in Arduino IDE.
- Proper connections made between ESP8266, buzzer, and power source.
- Wi-Fi credentials and ThingSpeak API key obtained.

## Setup

1. Replace placeholders in the code:
   - Replace `"your_wifi_ssid"` with your Wi-Fi SSID.
   - Replace `"your_wifi_password"` with your Wi-Fi password.
   - Replace `"your_thingspeak_api_key"` with your ThingSpeak API key.

2. Connect the buzzer to the specified GPIO pin (`buzzerPin`) in the code.

## How It Works

1. The code connects to your Wi-Fi network using the provided credentials.
2. The loop simulates different states by buzzing the buzzer and sending status data to ThingSpeak.
3. Each state is accompanied by a different buzzer pattern (on/off times).
4. The `buzzBuzzer` function controls the buzzer's on and off times.
5. The `sendDataToThingSpeak` function sends the status data to ThingSpeak using HTTP POST.

## Usage

1. Upload the code to your ESP8266 board.
2. Observe the ESP8266 connecting to Wi-Fi and sending data to ThingSpeak.
3. Monitor the status updates on your ThingSpeak channel.

Feel free to adapt this code for your projects and explore more functionalities!

## Note

Make sure you've set up the required hardware connections and have the necessary libraries installed before uploading the code.
